Section 1: Preparing to Install WLS Patch Set Update 10.3.6.0.220118
--------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
  WebLogic Server Patch Set Update (PSU) can be applied on a per-domain basis (or on a more fine-grained basis), Oracle recommends that PSU
  be applied on an installation-wide basis. PSU applied to a WebLogic Server  installation using this recommended practice affect all domains and
  servers sharing that installation. 
  
  Follow the below steps before installing the WebLogic PSU patch.
  
- Stop all WebLogic server processes

- Remove any previously applied WebLogic Server Patch Set Update and associated overlay patches 

- Update Java SE (JDK/JRE):
  For users of Oracle JDKs and JVMs, we strongly recommend applying the latest Java 7 Critical Patch Updates (CPUs) as soon as they are released.

  Certain WebLogic Server fixes for deserialization vulnerabilities that are provided in WebLogic Server Patch Set Updates (PSUs) depend on
  JEP 290 filtering and JEP 290 global scope filtering features provided in July 2018 JDK Updates and later JDK updates.
  These WebLogic Server fixes for deserialization vulnerabilities are not effective without these JDK updates, or later JDK updates.
  Oracle strongly recommends that you ensure WebLogic Server is running with a supported JDK version, and the following JDK update level at a minimum:

  JDK 7 Update 191 (JDK 7u191) or later (for WebLogic Server versions that are supported on JDK 7)

  Refer to the following for further information: Doc ID 1506916.1 Obtaining Java SE (JDK/JRE) for Oracle Fusion Middleware Products
  https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1506916.1 

- Unzip p33494814_1036_Generic.zip to {MW_HOME}/utils/bsu/cache_dir or any local directory   

  Where, MW_HOME is path of the Oracle Middleware Home.
  
  Notes: 
     - 	You must make sure that the target directory for unzip has required write and executable permissions
        for "user" with which the component being patched is installed.

     - 	On some platforms, the zip/unzip utility may not be able to extract the jar files in the zip correctly. 
	On Windows, the native zip utility will show a 'path too long' error. Java provides the jar utility which will avoid this problem, 
	e.g., jar -xvf p33494814_1036_Generic.zip

  
 - Navigate to the {MW_HOME}/utils/bsu directory.
 
 - Apply WLS BSU (Smart Update) fix for quicker patch application. This step can be skipped if the fix is already applied.
   https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2271366.1  
  
 - Configuring Memory options
  
    For Microsoft Windows systems
    Edit the bsu.cmd script and change memory options as follows:
    set MEM_ARGS=-Xms1024m -Xmx4096m
  
    For UNIX Systems
    Edit the bsu.sh script and change memory options as follows:
    MEM_ARGS="-Xms1024m -Xmx4096m"


Section 2: Installing WLS Patch Set Update 10.3.6.0.220118
----------------------------------------------------- 

   Ensure all the steps are taken to prepare for patch installation and then execute this step.
  
 - Execute bsu.sh -install -patch_download_dir={MW_HOME}/utils/bsu/cache_dir -patchlist={PATCH_ID} -prod_dir={MW_HOME}/{WL_HOME}
  
   Where, WL_HOME is the path of the WebLogic home, PATCH_ID is HYG5 (Unique identifier for WLS Patch Set Update 10.3.6.0.220118).

33494814  - Oracle® WLS Patch Set Update 10.3.6.0.220118

DISCLAIMER:
 
 Oracle recommends this Patch Set Update (PSU) for development and production systems in accordance with Doc ID 1306505.1. 
  
 This PSU may conflict with an interim patch(es) that has been applied to customer systems. If a patch conflict is identified, customers should determine, through review of the bugs fixed list, whether the interim patch was included in the PSU. If the interim patch is included in the PSU, the interim patch does not need to be applied to systems where the PSU is applied.    If the interim patch is not included in the PSU, the conflict probably arises because the PSU modifies the same module as the interim patch. In such cases, customers should contact Oracle Support, provide information about all patches applied to the system, and request an overlay patch(es) that will resolve the conflict.
